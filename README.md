This project is a demonstration of my personal skills for my 6th software engineering semester.

# AWS Live deployment

## build

```bash
sam build
```

### deploy

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

After this fill in your stack name and then deploy the frontend to a place of your liking.

Do not forget to update the endpoints in the frontend, as these are dynamically created when creating a new stack!
